* Manufacturer: [Esselte](/a/b/c/esselte.html)
* Name: Esselte Protokoll A4
* Review date: 

This is just a plain hardbound A4 notebook, with 5x5mm TBD. This is the note book I use for work, I have done it for years and have a lot of them stacked somewhere. I save them for archiving purposes, but very seldom go back to them.

The paper in this note book is OK, but now that I have pens which deliver a lot of ink, I sometime have problems with bleed through to the next page. The paper is not as smooth as other paper qualities either - some pens can feel rough when used in this notebook.

Still, I don't think I will ever use something else for work than this notebook - time will tell...
