Log of installation activities
-----------------------------
* Copied directories from siteinfo-web
* Deleted .git directory
* Added new virtual site to Aapache2:
Added this to /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:

<VirtualHost 192.168.239.132:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
    DocumentRoot /export/snw/docpad/out
    ServerName dummy-host.example.com
    ErrorLog /var/apache2/logs/snw-error_log
    CustomLog /var/apache2/logs/snw-access_log common
</VirtualHost>

* Added a new ip to existing interface
This must match the ip used in apache conf. Used 3 (instead of 1) below because there were other temporary ips in use.

ifconfig -a
ifconfig e1000g0:3 plumb
ifconfig e1000g0:3 192.168.239.132 up
echo 192.168.239.132 >/etc/hostname.e1000g0:3

* Built sited using bash bin/web-driver.sh -a build, verified ok.
