This is one of those pens that I have heard a lot about. It comes in .25, .3, .4, .5 tip sizes, so this is the second to finest of them. The tip has a special indented construction with a carbide ball, and the ink is made from biopolymer, which prevents it from feathering or bleeding. (Read more about this and the Hi-Tec-C family of pens (there are a lot of them!) in this [excellent article at Jetpens](http://www.jetpens.com/blog/hi-tec-c-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/629).)

The pen looks very ordinary, like any other cheap pen. It is nice to hold, it has a plastic grip are which serves its purpose with no fuzz. When you start writing with it, you notice the very fine line of this 0.3mm tip. There is some resistance on various papers, but it is no problem for me. 

The ink flows nicely even at this thin width and there is no smudging, it dries very fast. If you want to smudge, you need to do so almost immediately after applying the ink, after a second or so the ink is set - great!

I have used it both for work and as a pen to keep in my pocket together with my <%- @getPostLink('rhodia-side-stapled-a7') %> notebook, it works well in both situations. The cap is a disadvantage; it is more convenient with a clicker instead of having to take the cap off at every use.

The Hi-Tec-C 3 does not stand out considerably compared to other fine pens that I have (such as <%- @getPostLink('pilot-juice-038') %> which is about the same tip size), I guess I don't have the required sensory skills to see or feel the difference between these fine tipped pens.

All in all this is a very good pen, it could easily become my standard pen.

The cap. No marking that it is a 0.3mm, only that it is a Hi-Tec-C. To find the tip size, you need to check the label, which says LH-20C3-L; this means Hi-Tec-C 0.3mm Blue.

Even closer to the tip, and the spider is still there...

Comparison with the <%- @getPostLink('pilot-petit') %> and <%- @getPostLink('pilot-juice-038') %>; there is no doubt that the Hi-Tec-C 0.3mm has the finest line of these.
