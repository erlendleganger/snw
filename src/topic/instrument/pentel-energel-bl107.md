TBD: picture of the whole pen

This is a very nice pen, one of my favourites at the moment. This is mainly because of the feel when writing, it runs very smoothly across the paper. This is a 0.7 gel tip, so it is a bit wide for my taste, but I can live with that. The colour is really beautiful - I like violet, probably my favourite ink colour.

The grip area is excellent, rubber with a pattern, this gives a solid grip for my fingers. 

The mechanism is a standard retractable with a quite strong spring; I like that, because it generally holds everything in place at all times, there is no rattling when using the pen. 
TBD: The grip area

In general, this is a very nice gel pen: nice flow, fine line, beautiful colour, good grip, no rattling.
