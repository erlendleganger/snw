This is one of the nice gel pens. The grip is very good; rubber with pattern. It is also better than most rubber grips in that it doesn't rotate on the barrel, the shape around the logo area takes care of that.

Writing is smooth, the line is 0.7, so maybe a bit too wide, but it is very nice. The click mechanism is quite standard, but at least no rattling in any position. I don't particularly like the clip; metal is OK, but it is very hard and cannot be opened so wide that I would like.

The violet colour is very nice, but maybe a bit too much on the pink side; the <%- @getPostLink('pentel-energel-bl107') %> I have is better in that regard.

Colour comparison with the <%- @getPostLink('pentel-energel-bl107') %>. The Sarasa's violet is visibly lighter (more pinkish) than the Energel's.
