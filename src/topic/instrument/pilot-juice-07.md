I had heard much good about this pen, so I bought three Pilot Juice pens (this one, the <%- @getPostLink('pilot-juice-05') %>, and the <%- @getPostLink('pilot-juice-038') %>), just to get a feel for the different line widths.

The pen has a good grip section in rubber, it does not rotate on the pen and make it quite nice to hold the pen. The grip (and the clicker) is also coloured in the pen's ink colour, which makes it easy to find the correct colour when you have more than one (as mentioned, I have three and used them all in the same loadout).

The clicker mechanism is nice and the clip is very good; it is spring loaded and works around a hinge, which makes it easy to open and it can gape quite wide (ca 5mm actually). 

The Juice pens are really good to write with. The gel ink makes it flow nicely, but without smudging (this was not the case for example with <%- @getPostLink('pilot-super-gel-07') %>). The colour of this particular pen was a bit unusual (Coffee Brown), but it doesn't come out in a particular bad way when put on paper.

I have used this pen for work for a couple of weeks and like this (and its siblings very much). I am still not decided on which of the line widths I prefer - the 0.7 is most visible, but I have no problems using the 0.38 either.
