This pen gives a bit messy impression when looking at it, there are many
design components at work, while at the same time it's a bit boring.

The grip is nice, the rubber are gives good friction. However, it is a bit too wide for me, as mentioned.

The pen writes a fine, typical 0.5 wide, black line. This is what I like, then I can make detailed drawings or small text without the lines melting into each other. 

The mechanism is quite good, a distinct click both to open and close. The clip also seems to be good, although I almost never use the it for any pen.

I have used it for work, it is nice to make notes with in my 
<%- @getPostLink('esselte-protokoll-a4') %> notebook. I like the
thin lines, the black colour is a bit boring, but not a problem, of
course. However, it is a bit scrapy, it doesn't flow as nicely as I would
like. This is probably due to the needle point; it is really sharp.

This is an OK pen that I could use for work, but there are better
alternatives.
