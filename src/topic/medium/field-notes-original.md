This is my first encounter with the favous Field Notes; I bougth this three pack with graph, ruled and plain paper, including a Field Notes pen and a Field Notes rubber band. The notebooks are rather thin, seems durable. The paper is nice and smooth, and the lines for the graph and ruled paper are printed with a subtle line - visible, but not dominating.

I'm not sure which pen I should use with it, I need to experiment a bit here.
