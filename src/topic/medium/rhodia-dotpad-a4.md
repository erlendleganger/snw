This is a very nice notepad. The format is A4 with a bit added on the top, so when you turn the page over the top, the remaining area is still A4. There is no perforation, so when a page is filled, you turn it over.

The paper has a dot-grid, this is a bit unusual to me, I need to get used to it.

The paper is 80g/m2, very smooth to write on.
