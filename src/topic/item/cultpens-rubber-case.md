This is a very simple pencil case, made in black rubber and with the Cultpens company logo. The case is made by recycled car tyres, which is very cool. I feel that the pens don't move around too much in it, the rubber has great friciton, of course. There is nothing inside the pen case (other than space) - perfect.
