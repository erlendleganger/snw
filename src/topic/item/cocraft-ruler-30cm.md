This is a simple 30cm ruler that I use to create the margins I need in my <%- @getPostLink('esselte-protokoll-a4') %>. I used to have a plastic Linex ruler for this, but it broke too many times, so then I went for steel. It is heavy and stable, but has some shart edges, it may cut the inside of my bag (haven't had any mishaps yet, though...).
